# GithubIssues

A command line tool written in Elixir to get a list of the latest github project's issues.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `github_issues` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:github_issues, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/github_issues](https://hexdocs.pm/github_issues).
